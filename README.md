# Handlebars Quicky

Simple extension for handlebars to get up and running with minimalistic API.

## Background

When starting off with handlebars, for real practical usage, one requires a number of assistive libraries. For instance, saving handlebars templates and specs within an `HTML` page being developed is not a feasible solution.

This simple extension makes life easier for developers starting to use handlebars or for developers who simply need the tempting abilities of handlebars right out of the box.

## What do you get?

This extension makes using handlebars a stroll in the park. Simply store your HTML template in a file, your specifications in a JSON file and ask Quicky to process them and apply the result to a DOM element.
